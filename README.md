Carnegie Mellon generated this dictionary using the following independent
sources:

 * a 20k+ general English dictionary, built by hand at Carnegie Mellon
  (extensively proofed and used).
 * a 200k+ UCLA-proofed version of the shoup dictionary.
 * a 32k subset of the Dragon dictionary.
 * a 53k+ dictionary of proper names, synthesiser-generated, unproofed.
 * a 200k dictionary generated with Orator, unproofed.
 * a 200k dictionary generated with Mitalk, unproofed.

All entries that occur solely in copyrighted sources, like the Dragon
dictionary, are not currently included in this dictionary. If you have
words and transcriptions that you would like included in this unrestricted
resource, please send them to [Robert L. Weide](weide@cs.cmu.edu) and we
will consider them for an upcoming version.

All of the above sources were preprocessed and the transcriptions in the
current cmudict were selected from the transcriptions in the sources or
a combination thereof. We have removed some potentially unreliable
transcriptions from this dictionary, including those based on only one
source, and will reintroduce them once we have verified the transcriptions.

The Carnegie Mellon Speech Group does not guarantee the accuracy of this
dictionary, nor its suitability for any specific purpose. In fact, we
expect a number of errors, omissions and inconsistencies to remain in the
dictionary. We intend to continually update the dictionary by correction
existing entries and by adding new ones. From time to time a new major
version will be released.

If you add words to or correct words in your version of this dictionary,
we would appreciate it if you could send these additions and corrections
to [us](weide@cs.cmu.edu) for consideration in a subsequent version. All
final entries will be approved by Robert L. Weide, editor of the dictionary.
